# HST-GAIA
Pipeline to derive proper motions (PM) by combining HST and Gaia.

To get some help about the parameters type:

./download_data.py --help

Normally the code can be run just searching for an object name:

./download_data.py --name 'Fornax dSph'

In order to run the program, you will need to have the PARSEC isochrones and the DR2_RUWE_V1 tables in the Auxiliary folder.
